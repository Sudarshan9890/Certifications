## High-Level Design (HLD) for Order Square-off Backup Website

**1. System Overview**

This document outlines the high-level design for a backup website that enables users of ICICI Securities' retail trading platform to square-off orders during outages of the primary website. The backup system operates on a separate technology stack and activates automatically upon detecting a failure in the main website infrastructure.

**2. Components**

* **User Interface (Frontend):** 
    * Technology: A lightweight framework like React or Vue.js
    * Pros: Enables fast development and responsive design.
    * Cons: Requires additional effort for complex functionalities.
    * Authentication Mechanism: Secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) with two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
* **Web Servers:** 
    * Technology: Nginx (or similar load balancer)
    * Configuration: Configured for high availability with load balancing across multiple web server instances for scalability.
    * Security Settings: Implement security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and regular security updates.
* **Application Servers:** 
    * Technology: Microservices architecture with a framework like Spring Boot or Node.js.
    * Design Pattern: RESTful API design for modularity and easier maintenance.
    * Services:
        * User Management Service: Handles user login, registration, and account details.
        * Order Management Service: Processes order square-off requests.
        * Market Data Service (Optional): Provides real-time market data for user information (if not retrieved directly from the exchange API).
    * Communication: Microservices communicate through asynchronous messaging using a messaging queue like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
* **Database:** 
    * Technology: A high-performance relational database like PostgreSQL
    * Schema Design: Normalized schema with separate tables for users, positions, orders, and audit logs. Data should be a subset of the main database, focusing on information crucial for order square-off (e.g., user ID, position details, order status).
    * Data Synchronization: Incremental replication from the main database using database mirroring or log shipping techniques for near real-time data updates.
* **Messaging Queue:** 
    * Technology: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery between microservices.
    * Queues: Separate queues for different functionalities (e.g., order placement, data updates).
* **Monitoring System:** 
    * Technology: A monitoring tool like Prometheus or Datadog
    * Metrics: Monitor web server health, application server performance, database load, and queue backlog.
    * Alerting Rules: Configure alerts to notify IT teams of potential issues and trigger automatic system failover.

**3. System Flow**

1. User attempts to access the trading platform.
2. Load balancer directs the user request to an available web server instance.
3. Web server forwards the request to the application server.
4. If it's the primary website:
    * Application server interacts with the main database and exchange API for real-time data and order execution.
5. If it's the backup website:
    * User Management Service authenticates the user through secure token-based authentication (JWT) with 2FA.
    * Order Management Service retrieves relevant user position and order data from the backup database.
    * User interacts with the user interface to view positions and place square-off orders.
    * Order Management Service validates the order request and sends it to the messaging queue.
    * A separate process consumes messages from the queue and relays order information to the exchange API (if real-time market data integration is not implemented).
6. Monitoring System continuously monitors the health of the primary website infrastructure.
7. Upon detecting a failure, the Monitoring System triggers automatic failover to the backup website.
    * Load balancer starts directing user traffic to the backup web servers.
8. Once the primary website is restored:
    * Backup database updates are synchronized with the main database using pre-defined mechanisms.

**4. Additional Considerations**

* Security: Implement comprehensive security measures throughout the system, including data encryption at rest and in transit, user access controls, and regular penetration testing.
* Disaster Recovery: Design a disaster recovery plan to address potential outages beyond the scope of this backup website solution (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks).
* Performance Testing: Conduct performance testing to ensure the backup website can handle peak user loads during failover scenarios.

**5. Next Steps**

* Develop a detailed Low-Level Design (LLD) for each component, specifying technical configurations and functionalities.
* Implement and test the backup website solution.
* Integrate the system with existing monitoring and alerting infrastructure.
* Conduct disaster recovery drills to ensure team preparedness for switching to the backup website.
