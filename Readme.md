## Estimating Hardware Requirements (Stock Market Website) - 3 Million Users

**Scaling for 3 Million Users (Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations):**

**Assumptions:**

* 3 million active users
* 2% user concurrency during peak hours (adjust based on your research)
* Specific data volumes and transaction frequencies will be replaced with placeholders (X, Y, and Z). You'll need to fill these in with your own research.

**1. User Load and Web Servers:**

* Peak User Concurrency: 3 million users * 2% = 60,000 users (replace with your calculated value)
* Web Server Specifications: Research resource requirements for your chosen framework (React) to handle 60,000 concurrent users. This will depend on factors like page complexity and user interactions. 
* Estimated Number of Web Servers: X (replace with your research-based estimate)

**2. Application Servers:**

* Data Volume Estimation:
    * Historical Data: X GB (replace with your estimated data size)
    * Real-time Data Updates per Day: Y updates/day (e.g., billions per day) with an average size of W bytes (e.g., 100 bytes)
    * Total Real-time Data per Day: Y updates/day * W bytes/update = Z bytes/day (e.g., petabytes per day)
* Transaction Frequency: Z transactions per second (replace with your research on peak order processing)

* Application Server Specifications: Research resource requirements for your Golang framework to handle the estimated data volume and peak transaction frequency (Z transactions/second).
* Estimated Number of Application Servers: Y (replace with your research-based estimate)

**3. Database Servers:**

* Database Engine: Consider a combination of:
    * Time-series database (TSDB) like Amazon Timestream or Cloud Spanner for historical data.
    * RDBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL on RDS/Cloud SQL for user accounts, order management, etc.
* Storage:
    * TSDB storage: Depends on historical data volume (estimated X GB earlier). Account for replication overhead (e.g., 2x).
    * RDBMS storage: Depends on user data, order data, etc. Estimate size and account for replication.

* Database Server Specifications: Research performance requirements for your expected query complexity (e.g., filtering stocks, real-time price updates). Choose database server specifications (CPU, RAM, storage type - SSD/HDD) based on your query volume and response time requirements.
* Estimated Number of Database Servers (consider redundancy): W (replace with your research-based estimate)

**4. Messaging Queue Servers:**

* Queue size and performance:
    * Estimate the number of messages expected in the queue at peak times (e.g., stock price updates per second * message size).
    * Consider message retention policies.

* Research resource requirements for RabbitMQ based on your estimated message throughput and latency needs.
* Estimated Number of Messaging Queue Servers (consider redundancy): Z (replace with your research-based estimate)

**Database Size:**

The database size will depend on the combination of:

* Historical data volume (X GB in our example)
* User data volume (estimate the size of user accounts, preferences, etc.)
* Order data volume (estimate the size of buy/sell orders and related information)

**Important Note:**

These are estimations to get you started. Conduct thorough performance testing with realistic workloads to refine your hardware and database requirements before deployment. This is an iterative process, so revisit these estimations as you gather more data and refine your website features.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Network bandwidth: Ensure sufficient bandwidth to handle peak traffic loads, especially for real-time data synchronization.
* Redundancy and failover: Implement redundant network paths and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
* Scalability: Design the system to scale horizontally (adding more servers) as needed.

By performing this back-of-the-envelope calculation and filling in the placeholders with your specific data, you'll have a starting point for planning your hardware infrastructure. Remember, conducting performance testing and refining these estimations are crucial before deployment.

### Estimating Hardware Requirements

To estimate the hardware requirements for the backup website, we will consider the key components and their roles in handling the failover scenario. These estimates will be based on the expected user load, transaction volume, and data handling capabilities.

#### 1. **Frontend Servers (Web Servers)**
- **Estimate**: 
  - Assuming peak user load similar to the main website, we'll need enough web servers to handle concurrent user sessions.
  - For instance, if the main website uses 10 web servers to handle peak loads, the backup should also have 10 servers to match this capacity.
- **Configuration**:
  - 10 x Nginx web servers
  - Each server with 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM

#### 2. **Application Servers**
- **Estimate**:
  - Based on microservices architecture, we need to distribute the load across multiple application servers.
  - If each application server can handle 1000 RPS (requests per second), and peak load is 5000 RPS, we need at least 5 servers.
- **Configuration**:
  - 5 x Application servers
  - Each server with 16 vCPUs, 32GB RAM

#### 3. **Database Servers**
- **Estimate**:
  - The database must handle real-time data synchronization and user queries without performance degradation.
  - Considering a high-availability setup with replication, we need at least 3 database servers (1 master, 2 replicas).
- **Configuration**:
  - 3 x Database servers
  - Each server with 32 vCPUs, 128GB RAM, 1TB SSD storage

#### 4. **Messaging Queue Servers**
- **Estimate**:
  - To ensure smooth message handling between services, we need robust messaging queue servers.
  - For high availability and load balancing, 3 servers are a reasonable starting point.
- **Configuration**:
  - 3 x Kafka/RabbitMQ servers
  - Each server with 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD storage

#### 5. **Load Balancers**
- **Estimate**:
  - Load balancers are critical for distributing traffic across web and application servers.
  - Typically, 2 load balancers (for redundancy) are sufficient.
- **Configuration**:
  - 2 x Load balancers
  - Each with 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM

#### 6. **Monitoring and Alerting System**
- **Estimate**:
  - A robust monitoring system requires servers for data collection, storage, and alert processing.
  - 2 servers for monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- **Configuration**:
  - 2 x Monitoring servers
  - Each with 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD storage

#### 7. **Backup Infrastructure**
- **Estimate**:
  - Backup servers for database and file system snapshots.
  - At least 2 servers for redundancy.
- **Configuration**:
  - 2 x Backup servers
  - Each with 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 2TB HDD storage

### Summary of Hardware Requirements:

- **Web Servers**: 10 servers (8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM each)
- **Application Servers**: 5 servers (16 vCPUs, 32GB RAM each)
- **Database Servers**: 3 servers (32 vCPUs, 128GB RAM, 1TB SSD each)
- **Messaging Queue Servers**: 3 servers (8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD each)
- **Load Balancers**: 2 servers (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM each)
- **Monitoring Servers**: 2 servers (8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD each)
- **Backup Servers**: 2 servers (8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 2TB HDD each)

### Additional Considerations:
- **Network Bandwidth**: Ensure sufficient bandwidth to handle peak traffic loads, especially for real-time data synchronization.
- **Redundancy and Failover**: Implement redundant network paths and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale horizontally, allowing the addition of more servers as needed.

These estimations provide a starting point for planning and budgeting the backup website infrastructure. Adjustments may be necessary based on detailed performance testing and specific business requirements.
