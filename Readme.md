Sure, I'll provide a UML flowchart representing the flow of the system including the backup application functions. Here's a sequence diagram that covers the interactions from user actions to the backup system activation and operations.

### UML Sequence Diagram

```plaintext
User -> Frontend: Perform Trading Actions
Frontend -> Load Balancer: Forward Request
Load Balancer -> Web Server: Route to Web Server
Web Server -> Load Balancer: Forward to Application Server
Load Balancer -> Application Server: Process Request
Application Server -> Exchange Adapter: Fetch Real-time Data
Exchange Adapter -> TCP/IP: Retrieve Data from Exchange API
TCP/IP -> API Gateway: Send Data
API Gateway -> Messaging Queue: Queue Data
Messaging Queue -> Application Server: Process Queued Data
Application Server -> Database Connected Application Server: Update Database
Database Connected Application Server -> Existing System Database: Perform CRUD Operations
Existing System Database -> Monitoring System: Send Metrics and Logs
Monitoring System -> Backup Application Platform: Trigger Failover on Failure Detection
Backup Application Platform -> User: Notify of Failover Activation
User -> Backup Application Platform: Re-authenticate and Perform Trading Actions
Backup Application Platform -> User Authentication: Validate User
Backup Application Platform -> Square-Off Functionality: Execute Square-Off Orders
Backup Application Platform -> Order Management: Manage Orders
Backup Application Platform -> Data Sync with Main System: Sync Data Periodically
Backup Application Platform -> User Interface: Display Data to User
Backup Application Platform -> Error Handling and Logging: Log and Handle Errors
```

This UML sequence diagram covers the following scenarios:

1. **Normal Operations**: Users performing trading actions which involve interactions from the frontend to the backend components.
2. **Failure Detection**: Monitoring system detecting a failure and triggering the backup application platform.
3. **Backup Operations**: User re-authentication, executing square-off, managing orders, and syncing data during backup operations.

This diagram provides a clear and structured representation of how the system components interact under normal and failover conditions.
