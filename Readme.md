To handle user validation on the backup website while ensuring continuity and security, the database schema should include tables for users, sessions, and associations that ensure data integrity and relationships. Hereâ€™s an updated schema focusing on user validation and seamless switching:

### Database Schema for Backup Website

#### 1. Users
Stores user information, synchronized with the main website.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. User_Sessions
Tracks user sessions to maintain session continuity.

```sql
CREATE TABLE User_Sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    login_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_activity TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

#### 3. User_Accounts
Links user accounts between the primary and backup systems.

```sql
CREATE TABLE User_Accounts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    main_user_id INT,  -- Reference to the user ID on the main website
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

#### 4. Orders
Stores order details, synchronized with the main website.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    symbol VARCHAR(10),
    order_type ENUM('buy', 'sell'),
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    status ENUM('pending', 'executed', 'cancelled') DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

#### 5. Trades
Keeps track of executed trades, synchronized with the main website.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Trades (
    trade_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    symbol VARCHAR(10),
    trade_type ENUM('buy', 'sell'),
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    trade_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

#### 6. Positions
Stores user positions, synchronized with the main website.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Positions (
    position_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    symbol VARCHAR(10),
    quantity INT,
    average_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

#### 7. Sync_Log
Tracks synchronization status between primary and backup databases.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sync_Log (
    sync_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_sync TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status ENUM('success', 'failure') DEFAULT 'success',
    message TEXT
);
```

### Relationships and Associations

- **Users to User_Sessions**: One-to-Many
  - A user can have multiple active sessions.
  - `Users.user_id` -> `User_Sessions.user_id`

- **Users to User_Accounts**: One-to-One
  - Each user on the backup website corresponds to a user on the main website.
  - `Users.user_id` -> `User_Accounts.user_id`
  - `User_Accounts.main_user_id` -> Main website's user ID

- **Users to Orders**: One-to-Many
  - A user can place multiple orders.
  - `Users.user_id` -> `Orders.user_id`

- **Orders to Trades**: One-to-Many
  - An order can result in multiple trades.
  - `Orders.order_id` -> `Trades.order_id`

- **Users to Positions**: One-to-Many
  - A user can have multiple positions.
  - `Users.user_id` -> `Positions.user_id`

### Step-by-Step Workflow Example for User Validation

#### User Login to Backup Website

1. **User** accesses the backup website and enters credentials.
2. **Frontend** collects credentials and sends them to the **Load Balancer**.
3. **Load Balancer** directs the request to a **Web Server**.
4. **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Application Server**.
5. **Application Server** validates credentials against the `Users` table.
6. **Application Server** checks for an active session in the `User_Sessions` table:
   - If an active session exists, update `last_activity` timestamp.
   - If no active session, create a new entry in `User_Sessions`.
7. **Application Server** returns a session token to the **Frontend**.

#### Order Placement and Synchronization

1. **User** places an order via the **Frontend**.
2. Order details are sent through the **Load Balancer** to the **Web Server**.
3. **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Application Server**.
4. **Application Server** saves the order in the `Orders` table.
5. If the order is executed, entries are created in the `Trades` table.
6. **Application Server** updates the `Positions` table accordingly.
7. Changes are queued for synchronization and sent to both the primary and backup databases.
8. **Sync_Log** table is updated with synchronization status.

This detailed design ensures that users can be validated seamlessly when switching to the backup website, with all necessary data relationships and synchronization mechanisms in place to maintain consistency and integrity.

## High-Level Design (HLD) for Order Square-off Backup Website

**1. System Overview**

This document outlines the high-level design for a backup website that enables users of ICICI Securities' retail trading platform to square-off orders during outages of the primary website. The backup system operates on a separate technology stack and activates automatically upon detecting a failure in the main website infrastructure.

**2. Components**

* **User Interface (Frontend):** 
    * Technology: A lightweight framework like React or Vue.js
    * Pros: Enables fast development and responsive design.
    * Cons: Requires additional effort for complex functionalities.
    * Authentication Mechanism: Secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) with two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
* **Web Servers:** 
    * Technology: Nginx (or similar load balancer)
    * Configuration: Configured for high availability with load balancing across multiple web server instances for scalability.
    * Security Settings: Implement security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and regular security updates.
* **Application Servers:** 
    * Technology: Microservices architecture with a framework like Spring Boot or Node.js.
    * Design Pattern: RESTful API design for modularity and easier maintenance.
    * Services:
        * User Management Service: Handles user login, registration, and account details.
        * Order Management Service: Processes order square-off requests.
        * Market Data Service (Optional): Provides real-time market data for user information (if not retrieved directly from the exchange API).
    * Communication: Microservices communicate through asynchronous messaging using a messaging queue like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
* **Database:** 
    * Technology: A high-performance relational database like PostgreSQL
    * Schema Design: Normalized schema with separate tables for users, positions, orders, and audit logs. Data should be a subset of the main database, focusing on information crucial for order square-off (e.g., user ID, position details, order status).
    * Data Synchronization: Incremental replication from the main database using database mirroring or log shipping techniques for near real-time data updates.
* **Messaging Queue:** 
    * Technology: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery between microservices.
    * Queues: Separate queues for different functionalities (e.g., order placement, data updates).
* **Monitoring System:** 
    * Technology: A monitoring tool like Prometheus or Datadog
    * Metrics: Monitor web server health, application server performance, database load, and queue backlog.
    * Alerting Rules: Configure alerts to notify IT teams of potential issues and trigger automatic system failover.

**3. System Flow**

1. User attempts to access the trading platform.
2. Load balancer directs the user request to an available web server instance.
3. Web server forwards the request to the application server.
4. If it's the primary website:
    * Application server interacts with the main database and exchange API for real-time data and order execution.
5. If it's the backup website:
    * User Management Service authenticates the user through secure token-based authentication (JWT) with 2FA.
    * Order Management Service retrieves relevant user position and order data from the backup database.
    * User interacts with the user interface to view positions and place square-off orders.
    * Order Management Service validates the order request and sends it to the messaging queue.
    * A separate process consumes messages from the queue and relays order information to the exchange API (if real-time market data integration is not implemented).
6. Monitoring System continuously monitors the health of the primary website infrastructure.
7. Upon detecting a failure, the Monitoring System triggers automatic failover to the backup website.
    * Load balancer starts directing user traffic to the backup web servers.
8. Once the primary website is restored:
    * Backup database updates are synchronized with the main database using pre-defined mechanisms.

**4. Additional Considerations**

* Security: Implement comprehensive security measures throughout the system, including data encryption at rest and in transit, user access controls, and regular penetration testing.
* Disaster Recovery: Design a disaster recovery plan to address potential outages beyond the scope of this backup website solution (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks).
* Performance Testing: Conduct performance testing to ensure the backup website can handle peak user loads during failover scenarios.

**5. Next Steps**

* Develop a detailed Low-Level Design (LLD) for each component, specifying technical configurations and functionalities.
* Implement and test the backup website solution.
* Integrate the system with existing monitoring and alerting infrastructure.
* Conduct disaster recovery drills to ensure team preparedness for switching to the backup website.
